# INK CLI

Ink CLI is a Node.js command line interface for playing games written in [ink](https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/) and interpreted by [inkjs](https://github.com/y-lohse/inkjs) 

After running `npm install` simply run `node inkcli "ink_file"` with a ink JSON file as an argument. 

Play through the game by entering the number of your choice when prompted. Entering `quit` will exit the game.
